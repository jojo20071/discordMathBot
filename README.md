# Discord Math Bot

This is a simple Discord bot that can solve mathematical equations and perform complex mathematical operations. It uses `sympy`, `numpy`, `scipy`, and `matplotlib` to provide a variety of math functions.

## Features

- Solve equations
- Integrate and differentiate expressions
- Perform matrix operations (addition, subtraction, inversion, etc.)
- Plot polynomial fits
- Calculate statistical values like variance, covariance, skewness, etc.
- Perform Fourier and Laplace transformations
